This is my personal website, build using [gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) + [forestry](https://forestry.io/).

Currently listening widget on the [about](https://joshuarainbow.co.uk/about/) page uses the [last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) to pull the track I'm currently listening to from my [last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/TheTeaCat). Leave me a shout!
