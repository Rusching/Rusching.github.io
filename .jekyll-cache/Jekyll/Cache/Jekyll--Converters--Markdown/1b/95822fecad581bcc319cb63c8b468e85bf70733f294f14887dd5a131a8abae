I"ë<p>I would like to thank <a href="http://designyourownblog.com/about-dyob/">Marianne</a>, owner of <a href="http://designyourownblog.com/">DESIGN YOUR OWN BLOG</a> who gave me permission to link to her post where she is talking about blog image performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is blog image performance necessary?</p>

  <p>Consider this:</p>

  <p>Your users don‚Äôt want to wait more than 3 seconds for your page to load.</p>

  <p>Google pays attention to your website speed and ranks it accordingly.</p>

  <p>So I‚Äôd say yes, it‚Äôs very necessary.</p>

  <p>There are 3 steps (4 for JPEGs) we should take to optimize our images:</p>

  <p>Always resize the image to the largest size it will appear.</p>

  <p>Further reduce JPEG file size with these tricks.</p>

  <p>Reduce quality on save.</p>

  <p>Run it through a lossless image compression tool.</p>

<p>This Jekyll template was crafted in order to be used by photobloggers. If the photos you upload are not optimized, the page loading time will increase significantly! </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DO NOT upload an image at its full size, such as 2500 x 3500, and then resize it in the settings after you‚Äôve uploaded it to your blog!</p>
